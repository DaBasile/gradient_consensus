Put here the abstract of the project. The document must be at most 18 pages plus
introduction pages and bibliography.

The project deals with the design and implementation of a distributed
optimization algorithm in order to solve a Supervised Learning (SL) problem using a multinomial logistic regression.
It will use a communication
